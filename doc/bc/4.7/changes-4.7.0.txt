Changes to BC and behavior in version 4.7.0
===========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

- Revamped cluster index mechanism

  The cluster index system, used to serve images & binary files when running eZ Publish
  in cluster mode, has been revamped completely. Settings are now to be placed in
  config.php, and have slightly different names (they all start with CLUSTER_, for one).
  Documentation on how to configure the new version is available online.
  All index_cluster_* & index_image_* files are to be removed from the document root.
  Backend specific files are now located in kernel/clustering.

Change of behavior
------------------

- #019024: Mixed up class attribute IDs after re-order

  Content class edit form inputs have been changed for class attributes.
  They are now indexed by attribute ID instead of raw numeric index.
  Override templates for *content/class/edit.tpl* must thus be changed in the same way.
