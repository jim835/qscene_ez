Signature of filters
-------------------
{@see ezpEvent->filter()}

New filter added:

response/preoutput  ( string $templateResult )

Note: this filter 'response/preoutput' is triggered before the report,
which is printed at the end of the page, when debug is activated.
That way, you can use accumulator or append debug report
in your callback, they will appear in the final debug report
(at the opposite of response/output filter which is triggered at the very end,
after the report...)
